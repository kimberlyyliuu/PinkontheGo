# PinkontheGo

## Inspiration
As a team of young women, we understand how scary the world can be with men. Although popular rideshares like Uber and Lyft screen their drivers, we sometimes still feel uncomfortable when our driver is a middle aged man. 

## What it does
We created Pink on the Go as a rideshare platform for only women, driven by female drivers. 

## How we built it
We created some sample code of functions that we would implement for this app. 

## Challenges we ran into
Since we don't know Swift or any app development language, we still wanted to find a way to showcase our computer science knowledge. Thus, using what we learned thus far in our Intro to Python class, we tried writing some functions to demo some safety features we would implement

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is our first hackathon as we are first-year CS majors. Going into this, we were all unsure of how a hackathon even works. We're all really proud that we were able to produce something we are passionate about and showcase it to everyone.
